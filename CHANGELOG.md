# **Changelog**
### Version [3.5.6] - 225-06-23
#### Updated
* Retail interface version to: 110107

### Version [3.5.5] - 225-05-04
#### Fixes
* Retail: BiggerHealthBar.lua -> In an attempt to resolve the issue of the distorted player frame texture, I unregistered the following events from the player frame: (UNIT_ENTERED_VEHICLE, UNIT_EXITING_VEHICLE, UNIT_EXITED_VEHICLE, ). The trade-off is that there is no longer a fully functional vehicle UI, but I think it's worth it. If there are any unforseen issues please contact me.
*  Retail: BiggerHealthBar.lua -> In an attempt to resolve the issue of the distorted player frame texture, I unregistered the following event from the AlternatePowerBar (UNIT_DISPLAYPOWER). This should avoid updating the art on the PlayerFrame on shape-shifting (which is hidden anyways). If there are any unforseen issues please contact me.
